### Club Hub Homepage

## Problem

UH Manoa has many clubs available for students to join. There is no easy way for students to learn about all the different clubs and what, as well as how to join a particular club.

## Solution

A website that allows students to browse a list of clubs and get information on them. The website must also allow club admins that can change what there club page shows, as well as a super admins who can monitor the website for inappropriate content and make regular users into club admins.

The website should allow filtering of clubs by criteria ie: athletic, art, music.

Users should be able to specify interests and be notified when a club is created that has that interest.

Admins can monitor the website and create new interests.
